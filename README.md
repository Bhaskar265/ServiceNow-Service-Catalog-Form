Developed and implemented ServiceNow application that uses a Service Catalog form to expedite the airline feedback process. Workflows for submitting, accepting, and rejecting comments for three major airlines—American Airlines, Air India, and British Airways—across a number of categories, including food service, punctuality, cabin crew, and maintenance, had to be designed and automated as part of the project.

Phase 1: Design & Foundation
created and put into use application menus, vocabularies, and layouts to improve usability and navigation.
Set up ticket tracking number maintenance to guarantee distinct and traceable feedback inputs.
To provide safe and role-specific access, user roles and permissions were managed.
Record producers were developed for effective form development and submission procedures.
used client scripts and UI policies to improve user experience and enforce form validation.

Phase 2: Automation & Functionality
UI Actions now has interactive form buttons, allowing for dynamic operations and smooth record attachment.
Business rules were used to protect data integrity and enforce backend logic during the feedback lifecycle.
Events and notifications were set up to guarantee prompt correspondence and updates on feedback approvals or rejections.
created and put into place crucial workflows to automate the feedback review procedure, increasing productivity and lowering manual labour.

Result: The process of gathering and managing feedback was automated when the completed form was completely included into the airline's Service Catalog. The technology made it possible to submit comments more quickly, automate approval processes, and guarantee precise tracking and resolution.
Utilizes: Instance of Service Now (Washington, DC), Java Script is used for server-side automation and logic.
